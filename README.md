# blesso-todo
I started out with the basic [meteor/react TODO tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app). Sure it is yet another todo list app, but I was already looking for a real, collaborative todo list, so it is a great way to learn some new technologies. I've extended it by:
* Adding [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

## Features to implement
### Tech changes
* add react native
### New Use Cases
As a user,
* I can rename items in my checklist
* I can re-order items in my checklist
* I can have multiple checklists
  * I can add a checklist
  * I can rename a checklist that I created
  * I can delete a checklist that I created
* I can work with other users as a team
  * With a bribe to the developer, he can put me and other users into a team
* I will be in a team of just me.
* I can assign a checklist to a team.
  * checklist is only visible to team members
  * my checklist is assigned to the "me-only" team by default
