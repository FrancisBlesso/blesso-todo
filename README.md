# blesso-todo
I started out with the basic [meteor/react TODO tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app). Sure it is yet another todo list app, but I was already looking for a real, collaborative todo list, so it is a great way to learn some new technologies. I've extended it by:
* Adding [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
